	To create an asset, simple copy and paste the following into the module:
	
	["Template"] = { -- codename, used for the backend/datastores
		["Name"] = "Template", -- what the player will see
		["Price"] = 0, -- the asset id for the GAMEPASS. **THIS CANNOT BE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR A GAMEPASS.**
		["ID"] = 0, -- the asset id for the actual rbxm/rbxl, must be uploaded to roblox AND free.
		["Code"] = "" -- code to access the asset. setting this as blank will make it public.
	}
